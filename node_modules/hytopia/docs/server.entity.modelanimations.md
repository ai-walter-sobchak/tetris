## Entity.modelAnimations property

The animations of the entity's model that have been accessed or configured.

**Signature:**

```typescript
get modelAnimations(): Readonly<EntityModelAnimation[]>;
```

## Remarks

Animations are lazily created on first access via `getModelAnimation()`<!-- -->. This array only contains animations that have been explicitly used, not every clip in the model.
